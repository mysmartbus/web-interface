This will be the primary interface to control all of the widgets and accessories I'll be installing on the bus.

The modules currently included (as of 2017-09-22) do not actually interact with any relays, lights, or sensors. For the next month or so I'll be focusing on rewriting the modules to work on a 20 inch LCD display and an 800x480 touch screen display.
